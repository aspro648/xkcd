clickdrag.py is a script to grab image tiles from XKCD's "click and drag" web comic at
http://xkcd.com/1110/
- stores original 2048x2048 in results/
- resizes to 512x512 in thumbnails/
- creates "composite.png" from thumbnails.
- creates "clickdrag.html" which shows thumbnails and links to originals.

At 300 dpi, this picture would be 16' x 40'.
Zoomable example (not mine) at http://xkcd-map.rent-a-geek.de/
